# Base64 Decoder

This repository contains a simple Base64 decoder implemented in Python. The project consists of two main files: `decoder.py` and `main.py`. Below is a brief overview of the functionality and usage instructions.

## Files

- `decoder.py`: Contains the core functionality for decoding Base64 encoded strings.
- `main.py`: Provides a command-line interface (CLI) for the decoder.

## Requirements

The project dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To decode a Base64 string, use the `main.py` script. Example:

```bash
python main.py --input "your_base64_string_here"
```

## Example

```bash
python main.py --input "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh"
```

This will output the decoded string: "Hello World!"
